# sitecues-moodle-plugin

> A Moodle plugin for Sitecues.  Sitecues let users easily customize learning material – by applying magnification, speech, color themes, and other reading enhancements.  This plugin requires the purchase of a third-party subscription service.

## Why?

Sitecues let users easily customize learning material – by applying magnification, speech, color themes, and other reading enhancements. Each user can apply the settings he/she needs to learn most effectively.

A  common set of functions support users with diverse abilities and needs.  Sitecues helps users with vision, learning and language challenges, including: low vision, learning disabilities, cognitive issues, low literacy, non-native speakers, and older users with age-related loss of vision, cognition, and dexterity. Sitecues also supports situational needs arising from eye fatigue, small screens, low lights, and other conditions.

Sitecues can apply the following enhancements to all LMS content: page zoom, speech, color themes, mouse enhancements (size and color), highlights, and reading lens. User settings are retained and automatically applied, both within a learning session and between sessions.

Sitecues is built for first-time users with no training. Controls are simple and intuitive, and can be activated by mouse and keyboard. In addition, Sitecues includes audio instructions, on-screen tips, and a full user guide.

This plugin requires purchase of a third-party subscription service.
